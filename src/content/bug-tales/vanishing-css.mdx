# The Vanishing CSS: A Tale of Disappearing Styles

## The Problem

Users reported that the entire navigation bar would randomly disappear, but only on Tuesdays, and only for users with names starting with 'M'. This was one of the most bizarre bugs we've ever encountered.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Log in as a user with name starting with 'M'
2. Wait for Tuesday
3. Navigate to any page
4. Observe disappearing navigation bar
5. Refresh page - navigation returns
6. Wait 5 minutes - navigation disappears again

## Investigation Process

Initially, we thought this was a joke ticket. But after multiple user reports, we had to take it seriously.

### What We Tried

- **Browser Testing**: Reproduced across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **User Agent Analysis**: No correlation with specific browsers
- **Server Logs**: No errors or unusual patterns
- **CSS Validation**: All styles were valid

### The Breakthrough

The breakthrough came when we noticed the pattern was tied to:
- Specific usernames
- Day of the week
- Time-based intervals

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a CSS animation that was triggered by a specific combination of:

- **CSS class naming collision** with a third-party library
- **Browser timezone calculations** for Tuesday detection
- **Username-based cache keys** that conflicted with CSS selectors

```css
/* Problematic CSS */
.nav-m-tuesday {
  animation: fadeOut 5s ease-in-out;
}

/* This was being applied to users with names starting with 'M' on Tuesdays */
```

## Solution

Fixed by:

1. **Renaming CSS classes** with proper BEM methodology
2. **Removing date-based conditional styling**
3. **Implementing proper CSS scoping**
4. **Adding CSS-in-JS for dynamic styles**

```css
/* Fixed CSS */
.navigation__container--visible {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

.navigation__container--hidden {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}
```

## Lessons Learned

- Never dismiss bug reports, no matter how strange they seem
- CSS naming conventions matter more than you think
- Time-based logic in frontend code is usually a bad idea
- Always test edge cases with real user data

## Prevention

- Implemented CSS linting rules
- Added automated testing for different user scenarios
- Created style guide for CSS naming conventions
- Set up monitoring for CSS-related errors
