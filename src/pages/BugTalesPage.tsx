    synopsis: "A variable that existed and didn't exist at the same time, quantum mechanics in JavaScript, or just a really weird closure bug?",
    problem: "Variable was undefined in callback but defined everywhere else. Same exact scope, same exact timing, but somehow undefined.",

    problem: "Memory usage kept growing over time, but only after 24 hours of continuous usage. Component was holding references to setTimeout intervals.",

    problem: "Container deployment succeeded on Tuesdays but failed every other day. No changes to code, no changes to infrastructure.",
    solution: "Cron job was clearing logs every Tuesday. On other days, logs filled up disk space causing deployment failure. Increased disk space and fixed log rotation.",

    problem: "API calls were taking 30+ seconds. No network issues, no server problems. The mystery deepened when adding console.logs made it faster.",
    solution: "Triple-nested async/await was creating promise chains. Each await was waiting for the previous promise to resolve, creating artificial delays.",
